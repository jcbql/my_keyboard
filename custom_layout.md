The rabbit hole starts with these two excellent posts:
- [Tour of split ergo keyboards](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/tour/index.html)
- [A guide to alt keyboard layouts (why, how, which one?)](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/alt-layouts/index.html)

I may expand this section in the future.

## SNTLF layout
My keyboard layout is heavily inspired by [Hands Down Promethium](https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1g66ivi/hands_down_promethium_snth_meets_hd_silverengram/).

Rationale for some of the decisions (WIP):
- Putting L on the home row reduces the number of scissors.
  -  H is only used more than L in English because of the TH bigram ([source](https://norvig.com/mayzner.html)). I find it equally comfortable to type TH with H on the bottom row as the home row, so there are no downsides for me.
- F in the center column reduces pinky use
- Backspace is often repeatedly pressed. Why not use the strongest finger?
- The "Qu" button writes "qu" when pressed and "q" when held. In more than 92% percent of cases Q is followed by U [source](https://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/blog/language/analysing-english/bigrams/).
